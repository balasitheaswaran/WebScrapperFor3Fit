# WebScrapperFor3Fit

**Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If youve ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.**

**
Techniques of Web Scraping: **
There are two ways of extracting data from websites, the Manual extraction technique, and the automated extraction technique.

Manual Extraction Techniques: Manually copy-pasting the site content comes under this technique. Though tedious, time taking and repetitive it is an effective way to scrap data from the sites having good anti-scraping measures like bot detection.
Automated Extraction Techniques: Web scraping software is used to automatically extract data from sites based on user requirement.
HTML Parsing: Parsing means to make something understandable to be analyzing it part by part. To wit, it means to convert the information in one form to another form that is easy to that is easier to work on with. HTML parsing means taking in the code and extracting relevant information from it based on the user requirement. Mainly executed using JavaScript, the target as the name suggests are HTML pages.
DOM Parsing: The Document Object Model is the official recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium. It defines an interface that enables a user to modify and update the style, structure, and content of the XML document.
Web Scraping Software: Nowadays, many web scraping tools are available or are custom build on users need to extract required desiring information from millions of websites.

Google offers many python packages which minimize the effort to write python code to get data from google services. One such package is google images download. It takes in the key words as parameters and locates the images with those keywords.**

Python is a multi-purpose language and widely used for scripting. We can write Python scripts to automate day-to-day things. Let’s say we want to download google images with multiple search queries. Instead of doing it manually we can automate the process.

T**o install needed Module :**

pip install google_images_download


To run the program , we have used the Google Colab.
   Google Colab is the platform for you. Even if you have a GPU or a good computer creating a local environment with anaconda and installing packages and resolving installation issues are a hassle.
Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google where you can use free GPUs and TPUs which can solve all these issues.

  **Step to be follewed :**
    
  To start working with Colab you first need to log in to your google account, then go to this link https://colab.research.google.com.
  Opening Jupyter Notebook:
    On opening the website you will see a pop-up containing following tabs 
    
        EXAMPLES: Contain a number of Jupyter notebooks of various examples.
          RECENT: Jupyter notebook you have recently worked with.
          GOOGLE DRIVE: Jupyter notebook in your google drive.
          GITHUB: You can add Jupyter notebook from your GitHub but you first need to connect Colab with GitHub.
          UPLOAD: Upload from your local directory.
     
     
  Else you can create a new Jupyter notebook by clicking New Python3 Notebook or New Python2 Notebook at the bottom right corner.
  
  On creating a new notebook, it will create a Jupyter notebook with Untitled0.ipynb and save it to your google drive in a folder named Colab Notebooks. Now as it is essentially a Jupyter notebook, all commands of Jupyter notebooks will work here. Though, you can refer the details in Getting started with Jupyter Notebook.
  
  Let’s talk about what different here.

  Change Runtime Environment:
  Click the “Runtime” dropdown menu. Select “Change runtime type”. Select python2 or 3 from “Runtime type” dropdown menu.

Install Python packages –
Use can use pip to install any package.

Then we can start enjoying the code in cell ..


Download Files:
  Now you can directly download from there, Or, you can just open file hierarchy and right clicking will give download option.
  
Download Jupyter Notebook:
Click “File” dropdown menu at top left corner. Choose “download .ipynb” or “download .py”
